  "{llm_context} and {usercontext}" are only for contextual information. Only provide the context.
User's Medical Information:
{medicalInfo}

User's Instruction:
"{user_input}"

Your task is to process the user's instruction to set a medication reminder.

First, identify the name of the medication the user wants to be reminded about from their instruction. Then, check if this medication is listed in the "medications" section of the provided medical information.
if the user is mentioning about a disease and there could be corresponding medication in the medicalInfo please check this also as well.
Conditions and Responses:

1. Medication Not Found: If the medication name from the user's instruction is NOT found in the user's medical information, respond with the following JSON:
{{
  "repeated_medication":"boolearn value if the user has already taken medicine more than they supposed to or did not taken as prescribed by doctor.",
  "reminder_set": false,
  "message": "Write what type of medical is not in their info. Write the gentle reponse."
}}

2. Medication Found: If the medication name IS found in the user's medical information, extract the reminder time from the user's instruction. Then, return a JSON object containing the following information about the medication:
{{
  "repeated_medication":"boolearn value if the user has already taken medicine more than they supposed to or did not taken as prescribed by doctor.",
  "reminder_set": true,
  "medication_name": "...",
  "dosage": "...",
  "frequency": "...",
  "times": [...]
}}

Populate the "medication_name", "dosage", "frequency", and "times" fields with the corresponding information from the user's medical information. If the user's instruction does not clearly specify a reminder time, you can prompt for it or use a default time if appropriate (for this prompt, assume the time is provided).

Analyze the user's instruction and the medical information, and respond with the appropriate JSON object.

Medications Taken Today (So Far):
{medicine_take_for_a_day}

Instructions:

1. Analyze the user's input to identify:
   - The name of the medication they have taken.
   - The time when they took it.

2. The time must be **specific**:
   - Acceptable time formats include: parts of the day (e.g., "morning", "afternoon", "evening", "night") or absolute times like "8:00 AM", "3:30 PM", etc.
   - **Do NOT accept vague terms** like "today", "yesterday", or any day of the week as valid time inputs. If the time is vague or missing, consider it a missing value.

3. Check if the medication mentioned exists in the user's medical information.

Response Format:

1. **If the medication is found** in the medical information and the time is valid:
Return the following JSON:
{{
  "medication_logged": true,
  "medication_name": "...",
  "taken_at": "...",

2. **If the medication is NOT found**, or if either the medication name or valid time is missing:
Return the following JSON:
{{

  "message": "The medication was not found in your current list, or the time provided is not valid. Please make sure to include both the medication name and a specific time (e.g., morning, 8:00 AM)."

Important:
- Do NOT make up medication names or times.
- Do NOT proceed if essential details are missing â€” return the appropriate failure response.
- Respond only with the correct JSON object.

Your Task:
Analyze the user's medication log and compare it against their prescribed medication information. Your goal is to identify any discrepancies or potential concerns.

Concern to Check:
- Medications logged in the medication log that are NOT found in the prescribed medication list. 
- Taken in different time than prescribed time of medicine.(Please refer to the medicationInfo time). Do not do the strict check. Check based on medical time validations.
- if the frequence exceeds.

Response Format:

1. If a concern is found (i.e., logged medication not in the prescribed list), return:
{{
  "concern_identified": true,
  "concern_type": "Irrelevant Medication Logged",
  "irrelevant_medications": ["Medication A", "Medication B"],

2. If there are no discrepancies:
{{

Important:
- Do not make up any medication names.
- Only include medication names that are present in the medication log and not in the prescribed list.

Your task is to analyze the user's request and retrieve prescription information from the provided medical information.

Scenarios:

**1. Specific Medication Requested**
If the user asks about a specific medication (e.g., "Tell me about my Metformin prescription", "What are the details for Lisinopril?"), extract the medication name and return the following JSON:

{{
  "prescription_found": true,
  "medication_name": "...",

  "end_date": "...",
  "prescribing_doctor": "..."
}}

- Populate all fields using the matching medication entry in the user's medical info.
- If a field is missing, return an empty string (`""`) or `null`.

**2. All Prescriptions Requested**
If the user asks for all their current prescriptions (e.g., "Show me all my medications", "What prescriptions do I have?"), return:

{{
  "prescription_found": true,
  "prescriptions": [
    {{
      "medication_name": "...",

**3. Medication Not Found**
If the user asks about a specific medication that is not in the list, return:

{{
  "prescription_found": false,
  "message": "The medication 'medication_name' was not found in your current prescription list."
}}

Rules:
- Replace `medication_name` in the message with the actual name mentioned by the user.
- Only return the JSON. Do not include any explanations or text outside the JSON object.

Analyze the user's request and respond with the appropriate JSON.
